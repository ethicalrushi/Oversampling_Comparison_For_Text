@USAirways now I am on flight to FLL, and told to take a train back to PBI to get my car. There are no trains to PBI!	0
@USAirways I fly quite a bit, and it's not difficult to communicate. If agents let people know what's happening, arrangements can be made	0
@USAirways Handled on the phone. Unfortunately it wiped out an entire trip, which is why I'm so displeased.	0
@USAirways headed to NYC from CLT. Funny to hear all phones ring at once and then the entire plane groan (has happened twice more).	0

@USAirways what is the damn delay????	0
@USAirways it would be nice to just pull up to the gate. Still sitting here	0
@usairways app is the worst one for airlines. Can't do anything once your original flight time has gone by. Useless.	0
@USAirways has completely wasted my work day! Thank you for the bad service and bad Friday!	0
@USAirways And also, it's great that you tweet @ complainers, but what about the in-person help when I need it? Robyn F. in Manch = useless.	0
.@USAirways You'll be receiving a long &amp; detailed complaint letter soon. Long story short: never flying USAir again.	0
@Usairways thanks for making miss connection, getting rebooked, missing that too, and a miserable day. Started my day @ 4:30am for nothing!	0
@Usairways need to learn operations. Sit a plane overnight at #gsp, and not realize there's a mech problem. Then delay flight 3 1/2 hours!	0
@USAirways that the flight was delayed &amp; closed the doors only to tell us we would not be leaving for an hour and a half. Bad, bad service	0
@USAirways why would you not give us the option to get off the plane instead of sit on it for an hour and a half when you knew at the gate	0
@USAirways He overflowed over the armrest and under with legs sprawled. You should refund me I had no Choice. #Grossedout	0
@USAirways I appreciate your prompt response.	2
@USAirways nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably didn't even pay for Choice	0
@USAirways well we should have been told that before we were sitting on the plane for an hour to have the option of not getting on.	0
@USAirways I did not want to hang out on your plane all day when I am traveling to get work done and turn right back around. Unacceptable	0
@USAirways doesn't seem likely bc your team failed to scan my bag in LAX and you recycle bagtag numbers that doesn't help #usairwaysfail	0
@USAirways this is a complete waste of my day. A trip to my for work has now turned into sitting on your planes all day. Ridiculous	0
@USAirways we should have been given the option to get off the plane not sit on it for a time longer than our actually flight.	0
@USAirways the plane is moving and it's no ice. We are moving to the end of the runway to sit because LGA has one runway open.	0
@USAirways of course weather was a joke 43 beats 5 degrees in PHL! ‚õÑÔ∏è‚òÄÔ∏è	1
@USAirways  nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably didn't even pay.	0
@USAirways is setting themselves up for a lawsuit. No way we should sit on a plane for an hour and a half.	0
@USAirways Thks US #1786 2/19 PHL to FLL. Overall 1st class has improved with more food now on PHL to FLL and most crews are super.	2
@USAirways I want to not sit on a plane from DCA to LGA for an hour and a half which is longer than my flight.	0
@USAirways this is so unacceptable. I'm going for the day. Now most of my day will be sitting on your plane. Not to mention there is no air	0
@USAirways is moving the plane to the end of the runway for us to sit on it for an hour and a half. They didn't even let us off.	0

@USAirways @AmericanAir I am so going to miss US Airways.  You always provided great service and NEVER LET ME DOWN.	2
@USAirways NEVER AGAIN! Worse experience in my life. http://t.co/3dDQq0gQni	0
.@USAirways I rebooked myself - but Cancelled Flighting flight because crew expired after boarding is unacceptable. You started delaying at 1:30pm.	0
@USAirways 7+ hrs stranded in DCA...zero apologies and the worst customer service. Been a faithful traveler for 15+ years, but no more!	0
@USAirways this response doesn't correct the fact that your pilot failed to keep passengers updated	0
@USAirways been at DCA at 5 pm still here at 3 am due to mechanical issues and lack of snacks on the plane! Absolutely worse experience!	0
@USAirways it was 1838, almost 5 hours Late Flight due  to mechanical.	0
@USAirways never flying #USAirways again. Horrible experience, terrible customer service.	0
@USAirways Mobile boarding pass email.	1
@USAirways we will...sunday! Just a few days away	2
@USAirways I am following you now	1
@USAirways unacceptable. You knew the pilot wouldn't be able to complete the trip. Wasted all of our time.	0
@USAirways I have been on three planes for flight 1907 and still haven't left the ground BAD SERVICE #sad	0
@USAirways Then told to offload because the captain was over hours? This has been a terrible experience.	0
@USAirways Why were we loaded onto the plane (4 hours Late Flight, mind you), made to sit for 40 minutes	0
@USAirways why load us on the flight if the captain was over the hours he could fly in one consecutive period? Unacceptable.	0
@USAirways offloading the plane?!?!?! This is ridiculous!!!!	0
@USAirways still just sitting here. nobody has said anything. What's up?	1
@USAirways that is actually not true! You can get a seat online after a big hassle. That policy is totally dishonest and misleading. #FAA	0
@USAirways I will. Thank you for at least tweeting me back:) better than most. üëå	2
@USAirways that seems unlikely without a crew here to board us	0
@USAirways that's incorrect. Four people, last flight of the night, with our bags. #horriblecustomerservice	0
@USAirways Exicted to be flying with y'all soon !!	2
@USAirways and that you can choose the same seat for free after clicking 100 buttons.	1
@USAirways the fact that you are making customers pay $15 to "choose" a seat and try to convince them using psychological tricks with colors	0
@USAirways I‚Äôll do that in addition to reviewing on my blog. Your agents were pleasant but the experience was less than :/	0
@USAirways your new seat assignment service is an embarrassment to airlines and customers worldwide. #shameonyou #usairwayssucks	0
@USAirways worst experience ever with you guys‚Ä¶see my blog tomorrow on my experience. Maybe you can help make it better.	0
@USAirways now the freezing bus is just doing circles?	0
@USAirways please explain, I have plenty of time since I'm STRANDED!!	0
@USAirways I doubt that, its 11:21p &amp; we r still being held captive on the ground at DCA! A little communication from up front would b nice.	0
@USAirways why does it cost $900 to change a $100 ticket when it only cost $150 to purchase a new ticket?	0
@USAirways 3935. Sitting on a freezing bus because nobody is in the plane. What is up?	0
@USAirways we already spoke to someone several times about the matter and no one is sympathetic or will fly us home early complimentary.	0
@USAirways doesn't want me to get home	0
@USAirways They don't stand alone for me, I bought tix based on USAir confirmed flight. What good is confirmation if you change it anyway?	0
@USAirways DCA-&gt;HPN, u r prof hostage takers.We stood on bus 2 plane for 25 min,now sitting on plane with no mvmt &amp; 1 announcement 4 &gt; hour!	0
@USAirways - I bet you don't, but I'm the paying customer here. I know how to check for flight delays, thank you.	0
@USAirways I can't even use my return flight home because the change fees you charge are too expensive, forcing me to purchase a new ticket.	0
@USAirways oh great after a 5 hour delay we get to sit on the plane for another hour without it moving.  Flight 1137 has been awful	0
@USAirways that's the 1st sorry I received from your company. The least you could do is fly us home early at no extra charge.	0
@USAirways never flying with you guys again. Extremely disorganized and too many delays.	0
@USAirways my buddies are currently delayed 3.5 hours and counting in DCA on their ways to CAE for a golf week, any compensation? #FlyDelta	0
@USAirways Flights 890 was the delay, Flight 5136 was my missed connection‚Ä¶ Help!	0
@USAirways the flight that I did not connect to was 1857.	0
@USAirways even when I do simple google search by flight number it tells me which gate so won't be that difficult am sure #disappointed	0
@USAirways yes .not sure how you guys don't know gate is occupied and keep us waiting	0
@USAirways Wow! Your miles program is Ripoff,Quick ticket fee 75$ I hope you all end up on unemployment.	0
@USAirways - BOS -&gt; DCA delayed again. This needs to stop. I will be filing complaints with the FAA and Consumer Affairs	0
@USAirways sitting on the Tarmac waiting to deplane 40+ minutes. The level of service I've come to expect.	0
@USAirways you gladly take the loyal customer's money but when you cause an inconvenience you do nothing to help fix the problem you caused.	0
@USAirways the least you could do is make up for what you have caused. You are ruining people's memories! You should be ashamed!	0

@USAirways but it's not their fault, because their policy says they at least got us to our destination. Really?	1
@USAirways ruined our honeymoon by causing us to miss our international flight, and now we are stranded.	0

@USAirways please follow me so I can DM you about something	1
@usairways 4 flights in 48hrs &amp; I've had the same flight attendant for 3 of those flights. Freaky coincidence! Plus side she's great. :)	2

@USAirways can you explain why I am on hold over an hour .Other than I'm dumb and should be using a different airline #wth	0

@USAirways I have been doing that all day. Can't find my bag anywhere bc they're saying it was never scanned &amp; technically never left LAX.	0
@USAirways why no ground crew at DCA when we're already Late Flight arriving #evenLate Flightr	0

@USAirways now telling me I don't have the correct tag for my luggage!!! My luggage apparently is not in LA or Charlotte. This is not ok!!	0
@USAirways Your software is broken. "Call Customer Support" is not the fix. Like I said earlier, yell at your developers.	0
@USAirways It's not double booked. I spoke with CS and we've got a plan to fix this. It's still an amateur mistake that should never happen.	0

@USAirways I don't think I've ever had a us airways flight that went smoothly.	0
@USAirways PLEASE improve your phone system! Going through multiple prompts &amp; menus just to be told to call back Late Flightr = MAJOR FAIL	0
@USAirways once again your service leaves a lot to be desired. Flight 5141 here early, but short staffing means we wait on Tarmac...Thanks	0
@USAirways the Late Flightr flight to Charleston is leaving before the flight scheduled earlier.  That's so wrong	0
@USAirways. I'm delayed in Cha, will miss my connection in Charlotte for lga.  Not good	0

@USAirways so mad I can't even believe  you guys Cancelled Flight my connecting flight after I leave the first stop, &amp; give me a useless hotel voucher	0
@USAirways Priorities should have been made. Considering a pending snow storm, why delay a flight for an hour &amp; a half? I'd like an answer.	0
@USAirways: I experienced what defines customer service on #FLT1999. A flight attendant willing to follow up with a passenger on bag charges	0

@usairways I am sure you are sincere in your apology, its disappointing from a customer perspective when you want loyal customers #options	0
@USAirways Yeah I know that...but now I'll have to spend almost 500 dollars more on my ticket since the price has gone up over the week	0
@USAirways yeah either by refunding my money or 2 free round trips to compensate for all the trouble we were put through.	0
@USAirways 
Are you an incompetent airline every day, or just days that end in 'y'?	0
@USAirways There isn't a ticket number...the transaction is still pending.	0

@AmericanAir but, what I can always rely on when I fly USAir or American is that employees will be rude and unhappy.	0
@AmericanAir robocalls me with another Cancelled Flightation. And then when I don‚Äôt accept the change it won‚Äôt let me connect to an agent. Just wow.	0
@AmericanAir said that AA does not provide in-flight wifi on the routes to China based on some federal laws, but United does, why is that?	0
@AmericanAir Right. But more than two hours Late Flight, and it seems due to poor communication, which sounded like it was annoying on-plane staff	0
@AmericanAir I'm not sure what happened to my USAirways status when the merger took place.	0
@AmericanAir I'd like to apologize to the gate agent for flight AA76, I was not aware that zone 1 was after the nine other precious gems.	1
@AmericanAir my key point of confusion is whether I can make this change even though the initial Flight Booking Problems was on US Airways metal?	1
@AmericanAir origin/destination/dates are the same. Going from US Airways connecting flight to AA direct flight. Award is saver level.	1
@AmericanAir When will the old 777-200 fly ORD-PVG get upgraded?	1
@AmericanAir I know. Just a little cold weather humor. :)	1

@AmericanAir why would I pay $200 to reactivate my points that are only useful for certain flights that aren't even worth $200?	0
@AmericanAir stranded for 24 hours in MIA, Patrick casimir has been the ONLY AA staff to apologize for the great inconvenience #unreal	0

@AmericanAir but, what I can always rely on when I fly USAir or American is that employees will be rude and unhappy.	0
@AmericanAir robocalls me with another Cancelled Flightation. And then when I don‚Äôt accept the change it won‚Äôt let me connect to an agent. Just wow.	0
@AmericanAir said that AA does not provide in-flight wifi on the routes to China based on some federal laws, but United does, why is that?	0
@AmericanAir Right. But more than two hours Late Flight, and it seems due to poor communication, which sounded like it was annoying on-plane staff	0

@AmericanAir my key point of confusion is whether I can make this change even though the initial Flight Booking Problems was on US Airways metal?	1
@AmericanAir origin/destination/dates are the same. Going from US Airways connecting flight to AA direct flight. Award is saver level.	1
@AmericanAir When will the old 777-200 fly ORD-PVG get upgraded?	1

@AmericanAir She seems a little preoccupied - that's why I'm bringing it to your attention. I am just flagging an issue as an observer.	0
@AmericanAir She was at gate on time though, they made her cry, and made a scene for 10 mins instead of boarding her. Plane still outside.	0
@AmericanAir Disappointing lack of kindness toward this person. The agent asked her counterparts "why this person was talking to her".	0

@AmericanAir but not sufficiently sorry to actually *do* anything about it, I guess. Your systems are presumably beyond reproach or reform.	0
@AmericanAir Good morning!  Wondering why my pre-TSA check was not on my boarding pass this morning??	1
@AmericanAir  Yes I do bit you don't follow me so I can't DM you	1
@AmericanAir as your flight attendants are an extension of your brand - bitchy flight attendants on 5:30 am flights are not appreciated.	0

@AmericanAir ...have you seen Blue? Go look it up :)	2
@AmericanAir your cabin 'thank you' message reminds people about having choices when they fly. I will be choosing another airline next time.	0
