@united computers are down but you stopped giving updates and took my flight info off the app. That's just ridiculous keep people updated!	0
@united Soooo, it's been 15 days and you've offered no response. So I assume poor treatment by gate agents is the norm now?	0

@united it was UA381 on 14 Feb. Point is, overselling flights= bad. Making people wait 1hr while you kick them off after boarding is worse	0
@united that's brilliant Thankyou so much. Is it classed as part of carryon?	2

@united - SERIOUSLY it's 2015?!?!  NO WiFi on a 5hr flight from CLE-SFO #1589.  You're the ONLY airline without WiFi...	0

@united only thing confusing me is why I lost priority boarding? I'm a mileage plus card member üòî	0
@united We're hoping to hear from you actually.	0
@united shes been rescheduled for today, but with the frigid cold, being a possible reason for "maintenance" it could be the same issue 2day	0
@united It's the fact that an international should not be with out her bag and no sense of what's going on other than "maintenance".	0
@united b) I contacted you directly, and the phone service was Laissez Faire at best.  The problem isn't a Cancelled Flightled a flight.	0
@united a) she's an international. Her phone is on the fritz, I had to get to Chicago from nearly 4 hrs away to figure everything out.	0
@united sorry for the delayed response. It was UA #381 Chicago to San Fran. Held up for almost an hour on the Tarmac. Also, lost my bags	0

@united Tried filling out the status match form and got hit with an error message. How can I tell if it went through? http://t.co/JbDkxd6eFz	0
@united Is flight 746 going to sit on the tarmac FOREVER?????????	0
@united One of your workers refused to give me her name as a reference for my notes. Her tone &amp; language was very unprofessional.	0
@united that's why I blame your company. Because it had every opportunity to do a job and managed to fail each time for just lazy reasons	0
@united I wanna be grand staff	2
@united SF crew lack a lot of customer service, LAX employees are a lot better. Wonder why...	0
@united that's why I missed my flight. If the flight had been held for 5 minutes I would have made it. I watched it pull away from the gate	0
@united also didn't ice the frozen metal walkway. Wasted 40 minutes because no one knew how to do simple jobs.	0
@united your ground crew was inept and left a truck sitting on the Tarmac. Didn't have a gate agent once we got a gate.	0
@united I wanna be ride United airline! I love airplane	2
@united after 2 days - 1 flight Cancelled Flightled, another delay for 8 hours- united gave me a $7 food voucher. That's how much they value my time??	0

@united what the hell? Flight 746. Delayed since 3 pm, finally boarded and now sitting on the tarmac? Is this f&amp;&amp;%$cking plane Ever leaving?	0
@united Actually, the flight was just Cancelled Flightled! http://t.co/Qf0Oc2HqeZ	0
@united I am a loyal Premier Platinum member, but the lack of communication was really bad. Also, i don‚Äôt see that it has taken off yet	0
@united thanks for having changed me. Managed to arrive with only 8 hours of delay and exhausted	0
@united This is the 2nd time I was rebooked (w/delays), and for reasons unreLate Flightd to weather. How do I go about requesting a flight voucher?	0
@united If you consider 50 mins for bags @ 10:00pm on a Sunday night "as fast as they can", you should reconsider what you think that means.	0
@united It's the horrible attitude from staff after , not just the delay. Not the level of service or respect one expects from United	0
@united why do you want me to be loyal  if don't let me carry on my bag that easily fits in overhead	0
@united UA flight 1247. SFO to LAX took my carry on at gate. I'm Group 2, overhead bins are empty	1
@united On top of that I paid for 1st class and my wife got stuck in coach.	0
@united Ph the pat answers are BS. After I was denied boarding it sat at the gate until 9:05! Your employees totally suck.	0
@United Over the last week, United has provided me with the worst customer service experience of my life. Disgusting. #united	0
@united 24 hrs since flight landed and ZERO info on my missing bag? rough ETA would be hugely helpful + restore some confidence	0
@united big surprise #nogate waiting for our plane. Same fucken issues everything I fly you. #fail #worstairlineever	0
@united Not to belabor my point,but shouldn't I be able to put a laptop bag above my seat?  Why is it announced to leave it for rollers? Thx	0
@united maybemange the airline alittlebetter. Arrived at LAX and no GATE! #howisthatpossible always the same thing w/u	0
@united I just checked my united app and the most valuable use of this app has been removed. I can no longer see the status of my equipment?	0
@united even after running to gate from your connecting flight, your customer service not let us in the plane that was just parked. Stranded	0
@united I'm desperately trying to understand how my girlfriend is being treated with this Cancelled Flightled/delayed flight.  #unacceptable #ORD	0
@united Nope, no more chances. Your airline messed up both ways of our trip.	0
@united Why announce it is for rollers at all? If I want to put a coat in there isn't that my choice?  How about all gate checked? Thx	0
@united you're my early frontrunner for best airline! #oscars2016	2
@united  bags left behind because plane overweight, be great if knew as soon as we landed, instead letting us wait 45 minutes with no info.	0
@united You are a F&amp;$KING joke. Your customer service is woeful. If your staff tell a passenger that they will do something do it!	0
@united was a sponsor of the oscars? No wonder it was a half hour delayed. #Oscars	0
@united Worked like a charm. Bag was waiting on the carousel when we got to baggage claim. #welldone #goodflight #friendlysky	2
@united will lose my bag but won't give me free pretzels #frauds	0
@united you are trying to charge me 150 bucks because you lowered your award tickets and I want to get my hard earn points back, total BS	0
@united does asap mean two hours worth of delay and a return to the terminal to count the luggage a third time? #gottogetbetter	0
@united Apart from being on hold for over 2 hours and having talked to 5 people and the problem still not resolved!	0
@united typical caned response from UA, fix your crappy performing, last placed/ranked airline in this century!	0
@united is it even legal for you guys to advertise flights that you cant honor??	0
@united customer service is the WORST. hanging up on customers intentionally after one hour on hold.	0
@united was forced  to book a flight on a different date than originally planned for a higher price $1130 felt like a bait and switch tactic	0
@united love how you don't give a shit about people who tried to be loyal, but you screw them every way till Sunday. Glad I've stayed away	0
@united tried a different flight IAH-MNL 4/1/15-4/17/15, 6 flights are advertised for $1038 but are not bookable (due to partner error).	0
@united it will be on a different airline.	0
@united and was told that its been the case for weeks but is still not resolved.	0
@united clicked "upgrade now" and it didn't upgrade. What gives? http://t.co/N7oSjz8a59	0
@united you advertise the flight and its still on you website and still can't be book. spent over 2 hours with united support	0
@united tried to book a flight IAH-MNL departing 3/31/15 returning 4/17/15 you are advertising 9 flights for $1051 that can't be book!	0

@united is there nothing you can do for me? No compensation at all? Given the circumstances I feel like there must be something you can do	0
@united there is a disconnect between your PR group and the actual business strategy and employee attitude on the ground.  #liars #united	0
@united here we go again. 2 of 3 segments SFO--New York RT were delayed OVER 2 hrs each! Why do you suck so BAD!?!Maybe another line of bus?	0
@united you really screwed up dealing mechanical failure from Maui to San Francisco. Poor communication bad help in getting connections	0
@united if you don't like delayed bags, why do you let it happen so much?	0
@united the delay is due to customer service for 20 people?  What about the DIS-SERVICE you provided for 100+?  #FlightFail #Hour20Delay	0
@united he is so excellent and so reliable :) #happycustomer	2

@united I didn't have time to take my wet clothes/suit back to the airport and wasn't going to pay for another cab to do so.	0

@united, you just caused a riot on the airplane. Never seen anything like this	0
@united Instead of sending inaccurate emails about delay every 5 min, just say we will get you there when we get you there.	0
@united so glad I've been waiting for 1 hour and 15 minutes and Ive been transferred 3 times without resolving anything. Worst service ever.	0
@united we still need help. Hung up on twice. Customer service rep said there is no way to help between the gate rep and phone rep.	0

@united coupled with self-service policies/cost cutting exacerbates the noted issues. (3/3)	0
@united I appreciate the immediate offer, but suspect it is more long-term issue/not simple fix. Also, ski/bootbag policy is awkward at best	0

@united Thanks for explanation. It seems like an odd incentive structure, tho, because it dramatically diminishes the value of the certs.	2

@united FYI: continuous texts and emails I am getting about the delay while held captive on the tarmac are not that helpful.	0
@united so, not only were you Late Flight, you broke my luggage handle. You paying for a new one? http://t.co/nYVV1X3d67	0
@united: No friendly skies from you today. 5hr+ weather delay in SFO followed by 1hr+ mechanical delay while sitting on plane. #NoFun	0
@united once again your customer service rep was rude!   I asked a question and in turn got attitude.  Jane was no help.  Disgusted again!	0
@united can you not see the thread?	0
@united poor old United: never seem to get the response right :)	0
@united obviously the staff at EWR - United or otherwise have not seen your ads about - being FRIENDLY and helpful #ewr worst airport	0
@united also why can't I pre-select seats on SFO-&gt;YYZ flight? I'm a Canadian Flight Booking Problems on http://t.co/aZltJhf7lv.	0
@united does forelock guarantee the fare only or fare &amp; seats?	1
@united thanks! :)	2
Hypocrisy RT @united @gg8929 I'm sorry, we're not able to offer a full refund because the exchange rate is not what you were hoping for. ^KP	0
@united I shouldn't have to spend my own $$$ on a hotel because of a weather delay. The weather being something COMPLETELY OUT OF MY CONTROL	0
@united  eventually.  You should approach bags like @AlaskaAir  they get it.	0
@united What if my NYC flight is delayed and I miss my connection to Sacramento from Chicago?	0
@united said they would give us a refund. 30 days Late Flightr NO refund.	0
@united how can you not know the weight of our plane after us sitting on the plane for 2.5 hrs? Not convinced your company is safe for flt.	0
@united we showed up to our flight several hours early. Tried to call &amp; was on hold 15 min b/f call disconnected.	0
@united if your policy changed, you must advise at the time of purchase.  Same if you choose to vary it by airport!  We want a FULL refund!!	0
@united wanted to, but you Cancelled Flightled my tickets.... They were too special i guess even for united.	0
@united I'm 0/3 for Flight Booking Problems without major problems. 0% isn't bad!üëéüëé	0
@united @el_ingeniero don't check your baggage if you don't have to.  They will lose it!	0
@United I'm hoping we don't miss our LAX - ITO connection. Not looking forward to being stuck at LAX overnight with our team....AGAIN!	0
@united well perhaps you could highlight where that is stated.  We travel between Canada &amp; USA on United with only Nexus	0
@united how can you not know, after two hours of us sitting on the plane with no bags off loaded, the planes weight?!	0
@united You make it hard to fly with you. Delayed over an hour and now the plane  is turning around &amp; heading back to the gate. #connection?	0
@united  Serious firing needs to happen at HNL. They broke the wheelchair you loaned me after you broke mine! http://t.co/bT37KyrByJ	0
@united Call customer service and of course they just say "theres nothing we can do" and then offer a transfer and disconnect the line.	0
@united Now submitted for the third time, please check and confirm receipt. Have taken screen shots in case it disappears again. Thanks	0

@united flight UA3364 been sitting on tarmac for 30 mins with no report as to why...any input?	0
@united A 3rd party service you use to sell your tickets has ripped me off. Excellent service United is offering.	0

@united Yesterday, I'm sorted now.	1
@united thanks for that advice, so helpful. Can't believe you guys actually charge people to "fly" united	0
@united If you have had any issues with  United Airlines PLEASE retweet. Paid for a full fight ticket and was given a standby instead.	0
@united just tried to log in and was told e-mail log in not currently available	0
@united @gg8929 so why did you Cancelled Flight tickets for thousands of people when you didn't like the exchange rate? #doublestandards	0
@united do you have an e-mail address I can write my account to? Might be less likely to disappear	1
@united so I wasted 40mins filling in 2 online forms you are telling me you didn't receive, how do I know this won't happen this time?	0
@united 877 from amsterdam to ewr, 02.27.2015, 737-300.	1
@united stuck here in IAH waiting on flight 253 to Honolulu for 7 hours due to maintenance issues. Could we have gotten a new plane!?!? Fail	0
@united @UnitedAppeals @gg8929 What kind of hypocrisy is that? Only Cancelled Flightling tickets with bad exchange rate if in your advantage #united	0
@united No. The entire problem here is that I was never sent anything via email and only given a Flight Booking Problems number over the phone.	0
@united calling that number was useless. Heading to the airport now to pick up my bags. this whole situation seems like a real joke.	0
@united They couldn't get me first class on any of their flights so I just rebooked myself.	0
@united but the gate agent and club staff got me priority standby for next so might only be minor disaster...#travelingwithsmallkids	1
@united I'll be sending/posting complete details of the circumstances surrounding this matter.  United airlines should be ashamed.	0
@United Hidden City forces me into crappy seat even though exit row is available on the first leg. Your support cannot fix. :-(	0
@united JT thanks for your help I‚Äôll complete the form once we are back home	2
@united missed it.  Incoming on time, then Sat for 30, then no jetbridge driver...missed a 45min connection from an on time flight...	0
@united @gg8929 Ladies and gents - United Airlines...	1
@united You might be dealing with frustrated passenegers. hope you all have a great day :) thank you very much for an amazing airline :)	2
@united Allright! Last question : the power outlets on my flight are available in the premium cabin. Does that include economy plus cabin?	1
@united Well, It's LA and then a 2hr+ car ride to a dark Palm Springs technically. Maybe I'll get bumped to 1st class Den to PHL on Friday:)	1
@united yes still need assistance I don't have a flight home due to change in flight u made I miss all connections !	0

@united My flight UA1159 to Denver for #RMOUG15 has been re-cheduled 5 times.
If I am no show, you'll know why! Ridiculous.	0
@united you're just using automated  responses and don't have the decency to actually care/respond	0
@united JT the issue is with missed connections early gate closings and zero concern from customer service	0
@united here I was thinking how I could say so many nice things after getting upgraded, but then you delayed my flight... It's ok!	0
@united Can you explain how it rewards us elite Premiere 1K members?	1

@united The guidelines say 10x9x17, my bag is 20x15.7x8.7, so it's a bit taller than the guidelines. Is that gonna be a problem?	1

@united no claim number. Haven't been back to iAd baggage since. Is there a phone I can call to speak to someone?	0

@united worst service ever üòà	0
@united thanks for your attention. I would actually like to make a specific complaint about customer service at DCA. What is my best option?	0
@united can't believe United can't find someone to just simply check a seat back for a missing passport. Loved United but debating choice	0
@united I am furious.  You're firm is a disgrace. Despite all our efforts you did zero to protect our daughter. All alone at night # United	0
@united holy high speed internet batman!  Speeds at United Club at IAD are insanely fast!  Thanks	2

@United Your customer service for Mileage Plus customers is a disgrace. I just spent 45 min on the phone to reset a pin number, with no luck	0
@united No, I do not. I was only given a Flight Booking Problems reference number.	1
@united All these changes. Way to stick it to your Premiere 1K loyal customers. Why make things harder for those that loyal to you?	0
@united thanks for the offer, but I finally made it to my destination, albeit hours Late Flight.	0

@united I travel a lot and I get it. You're still my fave but EWR to Cleveland w/40 min layover to connect to DC = our best option? Come on.	0

@united flight 4567 agent now wandered off. Pilots came out looking for her. Went to charge her personal phone which she'd been txting on	0
@united waiting for flight 4567 to memphis. Incredibly rude gate agent waited until after departure time to announce delay. (1 of 2) #rude	0
@united I don't see how I need to spend an extra $100 bc of ur equipment failure.	0
@united I don't need to make any changes. I reserved my seats when I bought my tickets and there was an error &amp; now there are no comp seats	0

@JetBlue - Definitely no note from whoever stole from me.	0
@JetBlue but the 4 hour policy- when I called and they said I didn't report it soon enough. What would have changed if I had noticed sooner?	0
@JetBlue - Hopefully that will help someone in the future. Would there have been a different procedure if I had discovered the theft sooner?	0
@JetBlue - I did that as soon as I realized. Will they try to figure out who is stealing from people's bags? Security cameras? Anything?	0
@JetBlue - I did, but since I was stranded in SYR without a ride I missed the window of opportunity to have rights in this matter. (4 hours)	0
@JetBlue absolutely no worries. I'm just never flying with you again. Ever. Even I have to hitch hike cross country #passengersarepeople	0

@JetBlue yes. They are working on it. Hoping bag is on the next flight and will deliver home...	0
@JetBlue WELL...my paid tickets have NO assigned seats at all. So essentially I won't be on this flight unless I pay more.	0
@JetBlue If seats aren't guaranteed why do we pay for them? when I called the rep said some other people booked our seats.	0
@JetBlue thank you for the refund of the change fee for a recent flight affected by our bizarre winter. Excellent customer service and focus	2
@JetBlue yes, please get me the seats we paid for.	0

@Jetblue  I will keep on tweeting until your CEO answers and personally apologizes to my wife and the passengers of flight 136. Just Wrong!!	0

@JetBlue Seriously, what is your solution? Who exactly will help my 5 year old if there's a problem with the plane? http://t.co/vPDRPLXj5a	0
@JetBlue Your scheduling skills failed. The delay went from four hours to nearly six. Don't tell me you were snowbound in PBI.	0
@jetblue the man sitting next 2 me at the terminal has a scent tht i cant quite put my finger on. pls dnt let him sit by me on the flight.	1
@JetBlue sadly, no! I have the app, but it also is experiencing difficulties. The flight information boards are keeping me updated.	0

@JetBlue you're lucky we're still flying you after today's landing gear failure. Get your act together and help us sit with our kids!	0
@JetBlue so the prefference option is not something that you honor? So why having it as one of the services if not applied?	0
@JetBlue if you want to be helpful, find us a seat. Don't quote terms and conditions. #jetbluefail	0
@JetBlue do you REALLY think it's okay to sit kids away from parents?! Srsly?! Esp after your landing gear failure?? http://t.co/x6SYW3MDVu	0
@JetBlue they absolutely guaranteed us we would sit with our kids. Your "terms" response is insulting.  #jetblue	0
@JetBlue flight 1025 JFK to TPA 8:05am on Saturday! One way ticket!	1

@JetBlue Usually I have such a great experience with you guys? Very, very unhappy with you right now.	0
@JetBlue why would you hire a guy who doesn't care about the safety of children? Not remotely acceptable. http://t.co/lKFh9HYHW8	0
@JetBlue what's up? Three delays so far, resulting in over three hours of unnecessary, extra waiting.	0
@JetBlue For the record, that was less than a 10-minute turnaround time for the answer from the question.  JetBlue rocks!	2
@JetBlue never had an airline refuse to help sit parents with tiny kids. But this guy is willing to do it. #JetBlue http://t.co/MzZfGqfHu2	0
@JetBlue from San Diego with a 4 hour delay to JFK!Even you have a Amex  JetBlue, even having over 50.000 travel miles, you're still nothing	0
@JetBlue it seems almost inconceivable that sitting a 5 year old alone is considered okay. But this guy thinks so. http://t.co/q9n6NZYSpK	0
@JetBlue Third straight time that my flight has been delayed flying with you guys. This will be my last trip with you.	0
@JetBlue you've let me down. 2:15 delay at JFK because of inbound flight from Syracuse, really? #ishouldhavedriven	0
@JetBlue a 5 year old can't sit alone on a flight. This is absurd. And this guy is a dick. #jetblue http://t.co/2HXsDP0ha4	0
@JetBlue being told by this guy that he will not help us sit next to our 5 and 8 year old on the flight. #jetblue http://t.co/49FLbgzZkd	0

@USAirways I‚Äôm still disappointed that it is apparently ok for a Flight Attendant who isn‚Äôt up on current policy to argue with a traveler.	0
@USAirways yes I know the industry procedure on baggage. Thanks for helping..... üòâ what about the impossible connection that started this?	0
@USAirways I agree but per the captain this issue happened before boarding &amp; we all sat in the plane for almost 2 hrs	0

@USAirways I asked if that was SOP, and they said ‚ÄúIt is now.‚Äù But yet the other 11 flights, nothing. Is this a policy or not?	0
@USAirways while I‚Äôm asking‚Ä¶ 2 of my 11 non upgraded flights, Attendants came &amp; greeted me &amp; thanked me for my business b/c I was Exec Plat.	1
@USAirways 24 hrs of traveling and this just welcomes u back home to the US. 4 hr layover and I get to watch it going to wrong destination.	0
